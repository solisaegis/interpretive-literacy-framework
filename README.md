## Overview

The Interpretive Literacy Framework (ILF) is a non-authoritative, educational framework that examines how ethical and alignment-related claims are interpreted rather than how actions are prescribed or enforced.

It analyzes common interpretive failure modes—such as mimicry, strategic omission, authority laundering, and narrative compression—and introduces interpretive practices that increase scrutiny without reliance on scoring, certification, or enforcement mechanisms.

ILF emphasizes constraint visibility, counterfactual legibility without causal attribution, and the importance of human-in-the-loop judgment. It makes no claims of prevention, compliance, or causal impact.
